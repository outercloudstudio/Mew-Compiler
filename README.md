# The Mew Idea
Be the next step up from scratch as a language for people to learn.

## Examples of Principles in Practice
```
float velocity = 1

void update() {
    X += velocity
    velocity *= 0.9
}
```

# Todo
 - Support function calls
 - Resolve paths when dealing with dependencies and source
 - Support parameters in functions
 - Add control statements (for, while, break, return)
 - Support type casting
 - Validate and Type Compute Step


# Future
 - Support properties and namespaces (.)
